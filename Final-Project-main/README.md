Addison Isley Final Project

Overview:
"Dark Matter Collection" is a 2D arcade game using pygame and simpleGE

You are the captain of EFS1, short for "Earth Federation Spaceship", a research vessel intended on collecting samples of dark matter in space. Whenever a sample is collected, it is automatically transferred to Earth via a teleporter. However, in these "hot zones" of dark matter, other alien species have formulated blockades by harnessing the capability to throw asteroids at will, and it is unlikely to enter into these zones with an intent on returning home safely. Your objective, collect and transfer as many samples of dark matter back to Earth as you can before your ship is destroyed.
