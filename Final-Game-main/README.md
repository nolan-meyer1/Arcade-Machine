The goals for this project were to have a race car with drift mechanics that could go around a track with barriers it could not go through keeping it on the track. 

the only instructions the player needs is how to control the timer which are displayed at the top of the screen. pressing 1 starts the timer and if it is already running, it will reset it to 0 and start again. pressing 2 makes the timer ready to time the next lap. 

pressing 3 stops the timer and resets it to 0.

the techniques I used for the drift was to have the car get force vectors when the forward button is pressed which only go away with drag which allows for some sideways motion as the drag slows down the old forces and new forces are being applied in new directions.

the techniques I used to count laps is having the checkpoints that I am not currently using deactivate making it so the racer is forced to go around the track to hit the checkpoints in the right order to get a lap count.

the techniques I used to prevent the racer from going through barriers and have a bounce effect on the walls is to first move the racer back by their dx and dy and then reverse the dx and dy and cut them in half which gives the bounce effect on the walls.

for the car, I used rrcaseyr's car from open game art which can be found at this link https://opengameart.org/content/race-car

I learned how to create drift mechanics in the game and implement math into my coding. I also learned a lot with barriers and how to prevent the racer from going through.

I got stuck a bit when trying to get the drift mechanics to work but I eventually figured it out. 

I ran out of time so I wanted to improve the game by having a title/instruction screen with the option to play or quit. I know mostly how to do it but was more interested in getting my game better functioning before getting around to it.

I have almost everything the same as my game design except for there being no off-road, this decision was mainly because when I was playing the game, it did not feel like it would be as fun with the off-road.

My game being fun to me helped me stay on track (although it did distract me sometimes) just by getting me back into the program and giving me motivation to get it fully functioning
