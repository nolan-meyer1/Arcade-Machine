# arcade cabinet keyboard map

All input should be based on keyboard.  The cabinet will have a mouse and keyboard,
but in gameplay mode, only the mapped keys will be available as joysticks and buttons.
In your instructions, please indicate both a key and a color for buttons, so the 
game can be played on a traditional computer as well as the cabinet.
